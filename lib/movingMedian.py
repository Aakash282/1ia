     Purpose: Find the median for the points in a sliding window (odd number in size) 
              as it is moved from left to right by one point at a time.
      Inputs:
            seq -- list containing items for which a running median (in a sliding window) 
                   is to be calculated
              M -- number of items in window (window size) -- must be an integer > 1
      Otputs:
         medians -- list of medians with size N - M + 1
       Note:
         1. The median of a finite list of numbers is the "center" value when this list
            is sorted in ascending order. 
         2. If M is an even number the two elements in the window that
            are close to the center are averaged to give the median (this
            is not by definition)
